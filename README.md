# New laptop config and dotfiles

This repository hosts my dotfiles.
If you see something you like, take it.

I am also working on putting some Ansible playbooks and scripts here.
Because I am fed up with doing manual installations and want a portable configuration.

I might also use this space to keep some notes that can be shared publicly.
